# SnakeCLEF

This is a simple algorithm which illustrates the application of convolutional neural networks to image recognition problems in ecology. The task is taken from the 2023 SnakeCLEF competition, where the aim is to identify the species of a snake from an image and location data. The performance of the model is not great but is better than chance, showing that the algorithm does learn information about the data. We also demonstrate the use of Bayesian optimisation to optimise hyperparameters in a CNN.
